I have found a problem with the current toolset for accessing and understanding public information. Such as PACER EDGAR when it comes to readability and useability for the general public. in the way they have been made by and for lawyers and have technical language due to the need for precision.    

## Technical goals 

* searching through Public information

* Distilling public information into usable resources  Describing and graphing relations between public entities And within public entities

* Grounding claims in publicly accessible information 



# Why this matters
 This  matters because we have the duty and responsibility to challenge the current systems of repression. we need to know our situation ender to change it. this is the way we take action.
